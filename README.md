### About:

A fun to play 2d platformer about an old pirate in seek of treasures. A treasure map has led him to an island inhabited by mysterious creatures and filled with dangerous traps. Will Freddy The Pirate find his long-desired treasure? You are to find out!  



### Controls: 

- `A / <-` - move left
- `D / ->` - move right
- `space` - jump
- `Shift / left mouse click` - attack
- `ctrl / right mouse click` - heavy attack (reduces stamina)



### Some important notes:

- an executable file is already packaged and located in `packagedJar` directory. Just download it and launch either from GUI or terminal (`java -jar PirateStuff.jar`).
- java 18 or higher is required to be installed to run the program.
- the project does not rely on any 3rd-party libraries, core-java only.
- the game may look weird on smaller displays. This is the expected behavior, the game window was not planned to be resizable and adaptive to resolution changes. 
- Based on [Kaarin](https://www.kaaringaming.com/) 2d platform tutorial with further personal improvements
- Assets are provided by [PixelFrog](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters)
